## Our Motivation

Deciding what hospital is the best fit arises many questions:



  - What area will provide the best care?

  - Does one type of hospital offer better services than another?

  - Where can I go for the most affordable assistance?

## What our data consists of

Our data consists of hospital ratings from 2019

  - Our dataset contains 4,772 hospitals and has a rating for 24 different variables 

__Variables Used__

Categorical: 
  - Facility Type
  - Facility State
    
Continuous:
  - Facility Rating
  - Procedure Heart Attack Cost
  - Procedure Heart Failure Cost
  - Procedure Pneumonia Cost
  - Procedure Hip/Knee Cost

## Hospital Data

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
hospitals <- read.csv("http://www.stat.cmu.edu/cmsac/sure/2022/materials/data/health/eda_projects/hospitals.csv")

h1 <- hospitals %>%
  select(Facility.State, Facility.Type, Rating.Overall, Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost)

knitr::kable(head(h1), format = 'html')
```

---

## States with a higher population would have a higher cost of procedures

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
census <- read.csv("https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/datasets/2010-2019/state/detail/SCPRC-EST2019-18+POP-RES.csv")
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
population0 <- as_tibble(census) %>%
  select(NAME, POPESTIMATE2019)

colnames(population0)[1] <- 'state'
colnames(population0)[2] <- 'Population'

population0 <- population0[-c(1, 53),]
```

```{r,echo=FALSE}
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)

plot_usmap(data = population0, values = "Population", color = "red") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "yellow", high = "darkred", name = "Population", label = scales::comma) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

```

---

## States with a higher population would have a higher cost of procedures


```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
hospital_cost <- hospitals %>%
  group_by(Facility.State)
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
hospital_cost <- hospital_cost %>%
  summarise(Avg_HCost = mean(Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost),
            Avg_HFCost = mean(Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost),
            Avg_PCost = mean(Procedure.Pneumonia.Cost),
            Avg_HKCost = mean(Procedure.Hip.Knee.Cost))

colnames(hospital_cost)[1] <- 'state'
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
hospital_avg_cost <- hospital_cost %>%
  group_by(state) %>%
  summarize(Avg_cost = Avg_HCost + Avg_HFCost + Avg_PCost + Avg_HKCost) %>%
  arrange(desc(Avg_cost))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(usmap)
library(ggplot2)

plot_usmap(data = hospital_avg_cost, values = "Avg_cost", color = "red") + 
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "yellow", high = "darkred", name = "Average Cost", label = scales::comma) + 
  theme(legend.position = "right")

## Church hospitals will have the overall highest cost of procedures(w/o non-zero ratings)


```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
ratings_nozero <- hospitals %>%
  filter(Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost > 0, Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost > 0, Procedure.Pneumonia.Cost > 0, Procedure.Hip.Knee.Cost > 0) %>%
  mutate(all_cost = (Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost + Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost + Procedure.Pneumonia.Cost + Procedure.Hip.Knee.Cost) / 4)
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
hospitals <- hospitals %>%
  mutate(all_cost0 = (Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost + Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost + Procedure.Pneumonia.Cost + Procedure.Hip.Knee.Cost) / 4)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
hospitals %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Facility.Type,
             y = all_cost0)) +
  geom_violin() +
  geom_boxplot(width = .2) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Church hospitals will have the overall highest cost of procedures

```{r echo=FALSE}
ratings_nozero %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Facility.Type,
             y = all_cost)) +
  geom_violin(aes(fill = factor(Facility.Type))) +
  geom_boxplot(width = .2) +
  theme_bw()
```



---

## Church hospitals will have the highest overall rating

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
hospital_ratings <- hospitals %>%
  group_by(Facility.Type) %>%
  summarize(Overall.Ratings = mean(Rating.Overall)) %>%
  arrange(desc(Overall.Ratings))
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
hospital_ratings %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Facility.Type, y = Overall.Ratings, fill = Facility.Type)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.5) +
  theme_bw()
```

## Clustering Hospitals based on Heart Attack and Failure Cost

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
library(cluster)
library(dslabs)

clean_ratings <- hospitals %>%
  filter(Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost > 0, Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost > 0)
```

```{r include=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
#Standardize the variables
clean_ratings <- clean_ratings %>%
  mutate(std_log_cost = as.numeric(scale(Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)),
         std_rating_over = as.numeric(scale(Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)))
std_kmeans <- 
  kmeans(dplyr::select(clean_ratings, std_log_cost, std_rating_over),
         algorithm = "Lloyd", centers = 2, nstart = 1)
std_kmeans2 <- 
  kmeans(dplyr::select(clean_ratings, std_log_cost, std_rating_over),
         algorithm = "Lloyd", centers = 3, nstart = 1)
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
#Clustering Algorithm for Heart Attack Cost and Heart Failure Cost
clean_ratings %>%
  mutate(rating_clusters = 
           as.factor(std_kmeans$cluster)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost, y = Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost,
             color = rating_clusters)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  coord_fixed()
```

## Clustering Hospitals based on Heart Attack and Failure Cost(with 3 centroids)

```{r echo=FALSE}
clean_ratings %>%
  mutate(rating_clusters = 
           as.factor(std_kmeans2$cluster)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Procedure.Heart.Attack.Cost, y = Procedure.Heart.Failure.Cost,
             color = rating_clusters)) +
  geom_point() + 
  ggthemes::scale_color_colorblind() +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  coord_fixed()
```

### Conclusion

- The Northeast region of America has the highest overall cost of procedures

- Proprietary hospitals on average are the most expensive

- Church hospitals have a higher average rating based on the small amount of facilities they have operating

### Limitations

- Most of the data was categorical
- Data we could have used: Income, Health Insurance, etc.
